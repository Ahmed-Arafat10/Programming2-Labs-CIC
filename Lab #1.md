### 00. Some Important Points About Our Lab
- The Attendance is quite important for me, because ut shows how you are committed and discipline towards the course &
of course because are labs depends on each other which means that being an absent in one lab will 
definitely affect the understanding of the other one. Also, it will hugely affect your grades in the final
project/practical, for example if you attended most of our labs, but you got 12/15 in the final project, I will raise you to 15.<br>
I think know you realized how important it is LOL. <br>
`VIP Note`: attending less than 50% of the labs will mean that you will not have a final project, `Be Caruful`

- I want from you all to Create accounts on:
1. GitHub `Dont forget to follow me :)` 
2. Codeforces
3. HackerRank
We will solve some problem on them
- For each lab you will have 2 things, the lab recorded on YouTube & a documentation on GitHub (Just like what you are reading)
- Programming is like going to the gym, imagine you have a championship about bodybuilding, and you have  months to practice,
it doesn't make any sense to what all 89 days and then in the day before the championship you decided to go to the gym and workout for 6 continues hours, 
this is not gonna work AT ALL, the same is applied to the programming you have to practice at least 2 hours each week + attending the lecture & the lab each week,
so that your brain become familiar with the syntax and reading/writing code & most important to learn how to think and how to
convert your ideas into working code

- Programming is 99% logic, 1% memorizing the syntax. We are not going to memorize a dozen of chapters or pages that you have to memorize in order to 
solve the final exam, this is not the programming at all, it all depends on logic & PRACTICING
- Your life in the tech field depends on your programming level, this is a fact that you gonna realize later
- For each lab, there will be an assignment to practice `^-^`


## 0. Most Important Courses In The College `VIP`
- From my point of view (which depends on the market & the field),  the most important courses you will take in the college are (ranked from the most to the least):
1. Programming X (X means Programming 1/2/3)
2. Database X (X means 1/2)
3. Operating System X (X Means 1/2)
4. Network X (X means Network 1/2)
5. Data Security (System Security)
6. System Analysis
- These courses are the fundamental of information technology & software engineering fields,
  so that you have to study them well, not just to get an `A+` in the course, but to finish the course
  with maximum benefits from them

## 1. What is The Programming ?
- If I told you to define the Computer (programming) to a child, that will you say??
- Simply, programming is typing some words (statements) that are understandable by the machine (computer) to perform some task (solve a problem) instead of me (as a human being)
- This is the easiest & most forward definition of programming
## 2. Why Computer (Programming) exists in this life ?
- Or we can say in other word, what is the properties or the advantage of the programming (computer) compared to us as humans
- There are 4 main advantage of the computer:
1. `Speed`: if I told you to play with me a gain, if I told you to calculate in your mind the summation of numbers from `1 to 5`
then you will think for a while then you wil answer with `15`, but if i told you to get the summation this time from `1 to 1,000,000`, then you will be shocked.
When you learn how to code we will write this simple program to calculate the summation from 1 to N, the computer you will see will calculate it in a blank,
but you have to note that the computer is not smart like us, it just executes the commands we till him, not more not less, if your commands
are logically right then the output will be right otherwise don't expect a desired output
2. `Error Ratio`: We as humans may be exhausted, tired, not in a good mood, having problems in our live, not sleeping well, all the previous examples can cause the human to make error(s) or mistake(s)
while performing a task, unlike humans the computer does not cause eny errors, to be more specific in the previous example (calculate numbers from `1 to N`) you have the same statements (code) and you entered number `5`, the
output each time will be `15`, it cannot be 16 in the tenth attempt. Imagine you are trying to log in your facebook account,
can you login if you entered a password wrong, can the server makes a mistake and pass you, this is a fatal problem, so it cannot be happened 
3. `Availability`: If I told you to solve mathematical problems for 1 hour directly, you will not have any problem, but if I told you to solve problems for 12 hours The server (huge computer) can work 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. This mea
4. `Concurrency`:
## 3. History of programming briefly
## 4. Computer Architecture (Main Hardware Components)
## 5. What actually happens when a program is run ?
## 6. Logical Structure of the RAM
## 7. C++ Vs Java (Syntax Vs Principles)
## 8. Why we prefer using java in Prog. 2 ?
## 9. So, Is it really hard to learn Java ?
## 10. Structure of C++ Program
## 11. Data Types in C++
## 12. Physical Structure of the RAM
## 13. Run Time Vs Compile Time
## 14. What happens in the main memory when we run a C++ program
